# No Androids Pass
Using Google Wallet for the equivalent of the [No Homers Pass](https://github.com/sebug/no-homers-pass) project.

I'd like, if at all possible, to avoid the REST API - If I can sign the stuff myself, then all the better.

## Create your Business Account
To actually issue passes, you'll have to go to your [Google Pay and Wallet Console](https://pay.google.com/business/console/u/0/home) and activate the Google Wallet API.

## Create a service account in the Google Cloud Console
Make a new Google Cloud project for your passes.
